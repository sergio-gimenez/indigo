## What I'm currently working on

I work doing Internet related reseach at [i2cat](https://i2cat.net/).

* Spanish Project [Open-VERSO](https://www.openverso.org/en/), participant for the horizontal networking platform (Sep. 2020- Today):
  * Participated in the design of the interconnectivity for the federated testbeds.
  * Implemented a [RINA](https://pouzinsociety.org/) (Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) stack from scratch based on high performance packet processing framework ([Netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/)). 

* NG-SDN in private partnerships, participant (Sept. 2019 - January 2020):
  * Implemented a hardware dataplane for a RINA router using P4 language.
  * Setup of the testing and virtualised environment.

I hold a Telecommunications Engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC, July 2020) and did my bachelor thesis abroad about transdermal optical links with the Wireless Communications and Information Processing group (WCIP) at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH, July 2020). I obtained a [MSc in advanced telecommunications technologies](https://matt.masters.upc.edu/) (UPC, February 2022).

On my free time I volunteer on cooperation tech projects. Currently deploying an IT infrastracture in the Senegalese region of Gandiol, Senegal with [Hahatay](https://hahatay.org/index.php/es/). Projects are funded by the [Development and Cooperation Centre from the UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ccd/en) and most of the IT infrastracture is recycled and provided by [Labdoo](https://www.labdoo.org/en/)

## Side Projects

### Open Arms: Origine

Torture, extortion and even death are common situations faced during the journey to Europe. Migration is a fundamental right, and we defend it as such, but it is important that the decision to migrate is well-informed and chosen in freedom. [More info here](https://www.openarms.es/en/our-missions/africa)

Detailed techincal project report can be found [here](https://www.upc.edu/ccd/ca/accions-al-sud/projectes-2019/a034), as well as developed open source tools available at [@aucoop](https://github.com/aucoop/).

### Blood Pressure Under Pressure

[Checkout project website](https://sergio-gimenez.github.io/bpup-website)  
Client / server application based on mobile devices and open software OpenMRS that allows the automated collection of biomedical data in areas with little or no coverage of mobile communications. This system is aimed to local agents with low or null medical and technological knowledge that will improve the treatment of hypertension in remote areas.

### ieMaps

[Ceckout projet repo](https://github.com/sergio-gimenez/ieMaps)  
ieMaps is an inclusive and eco-friendly Google Maps implementation, a project made by a 4-people group in the HackUPC 2019 and then presented as final project from the BSc course on Distributed Systems Applications.

### Dyscaperoom

[Checkout website project](https://dislexiaupc.github.io/)  
Discovering dyslexia through the technology of VR. Project presented in [Everis](https://www.everis.com/global/en) within the UPC.

## Non-Formal Education

* I've been a basketball player, as well as coach of different teams, gender and ages. I learnt a lot from it and part of who I am right now is due to basketball. I'll never be enough grateful for all basketball gave me thoughout those years.

* I've been a member of [AEGEE](https://www.aegee.org/) and participated in [Summer Universities](https://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/), which are events in europe organized from young volunteers, to other students from europe.
